    {Pasta Aglio e Olio}
    {2}
    {15 minutes}
    
    \ing[200]{grams}{Linguine, dried}
    Bring a large pot of generously salted water to boil.
    Cook the pasta until just shy of al dente
    (about 1 minute less than the package directs).
    Reserve pasta cooking water.
    
    \ing[3]{tbsp}  {Olive oil}
    \ing[3]{cloves}{Garlic, thinly sliced}
    \ing[] {}      {Red pepper flakes}
    Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine the oil and garlic.
    Add the red pepper flakes (to taste).
    Cook over medium heat until the garlic is turning golden on the edges,
    about 5 minutes.

    \ing[1]{tbsp}{Olive oil}
    \ing[] {}    {Fresh parsley, minced}
    Transfer the pasta to the skillet along with $125$ml of pasta water.
    Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly,
    until a emulsified sauce forms.
    Remove from heat and add the remaining oil.
    Mix in parsely (if using) and serve.
